"spotifyQuiz": {"text":["This is my faviorate and best peice of work both conceptually and in terms of code quaility.The spotifyQuiz is a web app which allows users to generate a quiz based on either there spotify saved songs or they can choose any artist or any playlist provid it has over 10 songs. the quiz will then play a song which the user has to guess the song playing out of 4 possible options.The app is built using flask for the backend which connect to the spotify api to send the song preview uris and the front end is just js dom.In terms of imporovments I would like to improve the front end as it looks pretty ugly, theres also a bug when the quiz is loaded on the facebook messegan it doesn't play the first song,I think this is due to javascript not allowing sound to be played unless a button is pressed"],

"top_40_data": {"text":["This is a reserch project looking at trends in the top 40 music charts over the last 10 years it is built using dash.The data was gathered using Python and the web scraping package Beautiful Soup. The web scrapper gathers the chart position, song name and artist. The song name and artist is then passed through Spotify web API to find out meta data about the song such as song duration, BPM, etc. The data however is not 100% accurate as the name and artist from the official chart does not always match the name and artist on Spotify. This has led to a few covers being added rather than the actual song. There are also 52 songs that can't be found at all, these are usually songs which aren't on the charts for very long. A solution is to manually fix these which is a procedure I am working on at the moment."],
